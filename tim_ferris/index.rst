Fear setting (practice)
-----------------------

In his TED talk "Why you should define your fears instead of your goals"
[ted-talk-1]_ Tim makes references to stoicism as a framework that helps us
navigate the difficult times in life.

He proposes an exercise he terms **fear setting** which consists of
methodically defining your fears and examining their potential consequences.
Tim suggests doing this every three months.


Part 1: What if
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Define my fear by completing the sentence: **What if I _____?**

Example: *What if I apply for a new job?*

Then write down three sets of bullet points. This should capture *all of your
fears* about what could happen as a result.

The goal is to understand these fears and to evaluate them rationally - how
likely are they to happen, can the outcome be prevented and what would you do
if "the worst possible thing" really did happen?

.. csv-table::
   :header: "What could happen?", "How could I prevent it or make it less likely?", "How could I repair it?"
   :widths: 10, 10, 10

   "I might not get it.", "Read the job posting carefully and make sure I understand what they're looking for, then target my pitch accordingly and prepare myself well.", "No harm done -- I still have my current job."
   "I could end up disappointed.", "Understand that a job opportunity is never a sure thing.", "Realize that there will be other opportunities."
   "...", "...", "..."


Part 2: What are the possible benefits of trying?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Answer the question: *What might be the benefits of an attempt of partial success?*

The formulation of the question is intentional: We often think to ourselves
that making an attempt to do something has only two possible outcomes:
*complete success* or *complete failure*. In reality, there are many more
possible outcomes in between.

The goal here is to understand what you can gain from *trying*.

Example:

1. I might learn more about the job I want to have. It will likely help me to
   make a more successful attempt at a similar job in the future.

#. I might gain some interview practice.

#. I might make new contacts during the hiring process that could benefit me later.

#. I would prove to myself that I'm able to take action when there is something
   I want. Taking action this time (even if I don't get the job) might make
   taking action more probable next time there is something I want, because I
   see myself as a person who is not afraid to try.


Part 3: The cost of inaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Answer the question: *If I avoid taking action, what might my life look life
in... six months, one year, three years?*


.. csv-table::
   :header: "In six months", "In one year", "In three years"
   :widths: 10, 10, 10

   "I regret not applying for that job, I still wish I had", "I've exhausted all opportunities for growth in my current job -- I feel stuck", "I have lost my current job because I've stagnated too much"
   "I don't feel motivated at work anymore. I now go to work as a force of habit", "I'm starting to think that work is not that important to me anymore, because I don't get as much out of it as I used to think. I'm not investing much in my career anymore."
   "...", "...", "..."
