Mindfulness workshop
====================

These are notes gleaned from a mindfulness workshop.



Day 1: Calm, clarity and focus
------------------------------


Stress and the role of meditation (theory)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stress increases the level of cortisol in our body (a hormone that causes a
number of unhealthy consequences when we don't take steps to reduce it).

When we are faced with large amounts of stress our brain will sometimes go into
**amygdala hijack**, which means that our rational brain shuts down and we act
out of fear (fight or flight). Meditation can help to re-engage the prefrontal
cortex and bring us out of amygdala hijack again.

Ideas:

1. Run / exercise after work to burn off cortisol.

#. Meditate after work: on the train home, or before bed in order to sleep
   better.



Thinking vs sensing (theory)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We spend the vast majority of our day *thinking*. We spend little time merely
*sensing* or feeling.

Ideas:

1. Practice sensing when walking (eg. to the office).

#. Practice feeling when drinking something (eg. the morning coffee).



Breathing (practice and workarounds)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A common meditation is to focus on your breathing. The goal is to be in the
moment and to avoid thinking about other things. Breathing is used here,
because it's easier for the mind to maintain focus on something dynamic. If you
were to instead stare at the unchanging wall your mind would be more likely to
wander.

Common problems that arise:

* Focussing on the breath (esp. on making deep breaths) can turn into
  trying to control the breath instead and try to force the breath to follow
  a certain rhythm.

Ways to avoid this:

* Focus on the sounds in the room instead, instead of on the breath. Listen
  intently for all sounds, whatever they may be. They can even be the sounds of
  your own body (if the room is quiet enough).

* Trace your fingers. Use the index finger of one hand to trace around the
  fingers of the other hand. This touch creates a sensation that the mind can
  perceive and therefore pay attention to, making it less likely to wander.

Avoid assessing how well your meditation session is going, and how well it's
going compared to other sessions. The mind is ever changing, and your sessions
will differ too. Meditation is about practice, not about doing "well" or "not
well".



7/11 breathing and anchoring to calm down (practice)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We often feel stress physically in the upper part of the body (eg. the chest).

This is a good practice to do when you feel stressed in a heated moment.

Instructions:

1. Do this standing up.

#. Breathe in slowly (7 seconds). Breathe out even more slowly (11 seconds).
   The out-breath should be longer than the in-breath.

#. Focus your attention on the lower part of your body (your legs, your feet).
   Feel the weight of your body on your feet.






Day 2: Leaning into uncertainty
-------------------------------



Rational thinking (theory)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We spend the vast majority of our day *thinking rationally*. We leave only a small
proportion of time letting the mind wander.

Even so:

* 90% of the thoughts we think are the same from day to day.

* We know that intuition and creativity comes from *an unfocused mind*, a mind
  left free to wander.

Ideas:

1. Plan time in the day to intentionally let the mind wander. Practice sensing,
   instead of thinking. To stimulate creativity.



Emotions and the rational mind (theory)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As much as we like to think that we are rational, we know that emotions impact
our thinking very strongly.

What's surprising is that:

* **An emotion lasts only 90 seconds.** It is our thoughts (the habit of
  rumination) that sometimes keeps the emotion alive for hours or days!

* Mindfulness allows us to *notice* what is triggering the emotion in us.
  Without we don't understand why we feel how we feel (eg. angry).



Thought buses (practice)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Picture your mind being like a bus terminal. Buses arrive all the time, ready
to pick up passengers. In your mind, *thought buses* arrive, ready to take you
away for a ride.

The nature of the mind is such that thoughts arrive endlessly, *but you are not
obligated to pursue each thought*. You can decide not to get on the bus.

Instructions:

1. Take six long breaths, inhaling and exhaling.

#. Observe your thought as they come and go. Notice the thoughts as they
   appear, but without getting on the bus. Simply watch them disappear again.
